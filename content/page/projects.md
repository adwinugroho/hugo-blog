#### Microcontroller
**Arduino (C Programming Languange)**

Basal body temperature is used to determine when a woman will ovulate. The aim of this project is to design and build an automatic body temperature monitoring tool. The tools used are microcontroller ESP866 and MLX90614 censored.


### 2019
#### Web Development
**PHP CodeIgniter 3, WordPress, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS**

Develop and design web for consume json data from microcontroller I build before. Wordpress used for Content Management Server, graphic basal body temprature using chart JS 

### 2019
#### Data Science
**R with Rstudio**

Prediction of fertility in women using State-Space modeling based on Basal Body Temperature (BBT). State-space modeling is implemented with R programming language and Rstudio.

#### Data Science
**R with Rstudio**

The implementation of C50 algorithm in this project is used for analyze the amount of oxygen and human heart rate. Where there are many estimates of factors that cause heart disease in humans accompanied by increasing age. Therefore this algorithm discusses oxygen levels and heart rates. The C50 algorithm is implemented with R programming language and Rstudio.
